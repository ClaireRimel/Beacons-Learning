# Beacons-Learning

By developing this app, my goal is to learn how to work with the *iBeacon* protocol, *Bluetooth Low Energy* and the related *CoreLocation* and *CoreBluetooth* monitoring APIs. Also, I'll implement the UI using *SwiftUI*.

The main feature of this app is to provide feedback to the user when an specific *iBeacon* is near to the iPhone. The Beacons used will be [Estimotes](https://estimote.com/).
